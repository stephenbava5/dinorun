# Dino Run - Jungle Adventure Game

Welcome to **Dino Run**, a Python game where you learn game development while having fun!

## 🎮 Game Concept

You're running through a jungle, and a dinosaur is chasing you! Your goal is to:
- Avoid obstacles in your path
- Stay alive as long as possible
- Dodge the dinosaur
- Rack up the highest score!

## 🌴 Jungle Theme

The game uses a jungle-themed color scheme:
- **Dark Green** (#225723) - Dense jungle
- **Light Green** (#4CAF50) - Canopy
- **Golden** (#FFC107) - Sunlight
- **Brown** (#664321) - Trees and earth

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the game:**
   ```bash
   python dino_run.py
   ```

3. **Controls:**
   - **SPACE** - Start the game from the welcome screen
   - **ESC** - Return to welcome screen or quit the game

## 📚 Learning Objectives

As we build this game together, you'll learn:

### Basic Concepts
- ✅ Using the Pygame library
- ✅ Creating a game window and drawing shapes
- ✅ Handling keyboard input
- ✅ Working with colors and fonts
- ✅ Organizing code with classes

### Coming Next
- Game state management (welcome → playing → game over)
- Creating game characters (player, dinosaur)
- Collision detection
- Score tracking
- Sound effects
- Difficulty progression

## 🎯 Game Phases

**Phase 1 (Now):** Welcome screen with jungle theming ✅
**Phase 2:** Add a player character that moves
**Phase 3:** Add obstacles to avoid
**Phase 4:** Add the dinosaur chase mechanic
**Phase 5:** Add scoring and game over screen
**Phase 6:** Polish with sounds and effects

## 💡 Tips for Learning

1. **Read the code comments** - They explain what each part does
2. **Experiment** - Try changing colors, fonts, and messages
3. **Ask questions** - Understanding "why" is important
4. **Build incrementally** - Each phase adds new features
5. **Have fun** - Game development is about creativity!
